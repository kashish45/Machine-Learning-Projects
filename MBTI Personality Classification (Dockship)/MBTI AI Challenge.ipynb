       "' yep  yep  yep  especially the last one     yep  agree    yep  sounds like me   funny to have your personality explained so simply by someone else    someone wrote that in a thread here  and i thought it was a great quote   i was wondering  how do you use your empathy and intuition in your everyday life to effectively manage people or handle      oh  gosh yes      never knew this was an infp trait    i think you re right   it can make us vulnerable to suggestion    i understand your point but also realize that feeling these feelings of others is not something which is always voluntary   it s not something you consciously seek out   it just happens that you get      hit  nail  on  head   happy    i think infps are cerebral  they tend to think through things before speaking   they try to connect various thoughts and ideas in a way that makes sense to them before sharing it with anyone   so       yes  when i m stressed and feeling overwhelmed in these instances  my irrational mind takes over and races a mile an minute with the most crazy thoughts when i m stressed in this mode  my mind goes      so  i m finding that it s sometimes a little difficult to quiet the mind  and maintain a sense of calm   i actively find new strategies to help me regain and maintain a feeling of separateness or      the following are my favorites so far    attraction doesn t always mean someone is a good or right fit   and yeah  relationship skills are key   if partners don t listen or respect each other across those generational gaps  then it will      i answered this in another part of the forum but i ll add my opinion here  happy   i used to idealize the younger older relationship and really wanted to be in that kind of relationship until i      i admit that on many occasions  i have read a little too much into someone s facial expressions and found myself confirming biases than truly being impartial or objective about what i was seeing   i      or you use your lunch time at work to catch up on reading or look out the window of the cafe or cafeteria wondering what others things you d love to be doing    yes  guilty of this  seeing or reading things in people s facial expressions  underlying feelings or vibes which scream out at me while the person and everyone else thinks it s below the surface   or      to support what others have said  yes  usually if someone regardless of type  discuss an issue by talking it through with us  then it probably helps   they tend to feel accepted and comfortable      sometimes  it makes me think i m paranoid and just seeing things  which i admit can be a possibility  unsure  but it does make me feel a little awesome to know that i can pick up on things others may      i think the infp is just reacting to your strong belief that you are right because you believe you are more logical or objective because of your t   they are responding to your assumption that      not sure if this is an infp thing or an nf thing  but do you notice subtle differences in meaning when observing or communicating with people   do you find that you can take something apart and break      how do you feel when someone confides in you    feels good that someone feels they can trust me with that info and feels good to know they think i can be that person who can handle their crap          yep   i ll lay around for a long period of time doing nothing then suddenly get this surge of energy and then try to do many things in the evening or at night  things i should have done earlier in      my favorites   dry    love should never be just a many splendored thing   it should be a many treasured thing    potayto  potaaato  tomayto  tomato  let s just call the whole thing a vegetable slop    yep  yep  yep   sooo true   i found out a while back that this is called catastrophizing   and i do it a lot   it s almost like second nature    agree   one sided relationships are not worth it in the long run   and clearly aren t fair to the partner who invests quite a bit sometimes at great cost without receiving very much in return    yes  it s our way of connecting with our fi since we sometimes have to keep it tucked away in the shadows in our day to day lives   it s our time to breathe or exhale    seeming all business and serious usually does it sometimes   but unfortunately  they also can make people think something is wrong and want to talk to me even more   so  maybe that doesn t work so      introversion is that time for me to just be without trying too hard to be something else   being around people makes me self conscious and consequently other directed   i often act and behave in ways      leoni so much of what you ve said clicks with me  i don t like being in a fish bowl or being the center of attention  i work in a small office right now  and i like it  it s more relaxed  i like the      sometimes  i am not sure what works until i meet someone   it s sometimes the qualities of the individual which attracts you rather than a particular set of qualities   for example  the last person i      this      pls  stop reading my mind   laughing   seriously  this is very true though   thought it was just me    yes  i do it but i am also realizing how uncomfortable it can be for the person being observed in this way   when i m not sure of someone and i m still figuring them out  i tend to observe them quite      if you re a good french teacher  that s good   we need more of those    both and none at all   sometimes  i want to hide myself to protect it from the abuses of the world or protect the world from me  laughing  and sometimes  i want to seek which for me means  allowing      i am very guarded as a result of the experiences i ve had over the years   i don t really think of people the way i once did as a result of these perceptions   it s tiring fighting these perceptions      yeah  and they also believe that if you dislike and avoid conflict  that you re unable to understand the true nature of the world  or not capable of seeing the world as it is  they assume that being      one thing is the belief that certain qualities give the impression of being childlike  such as shyness and not expressing certainty when giving your opinions or not stating your opinions decidedly       agree  i am not sure i would dislike the formal or strict aspects since i have a little of that in me because of how i grew up   but i d probably be more into the art stuff  although i m not the      when you re the reluctant victim of an ongoing double standard which says  it s ok if someone else is upset and expresses it but it s not ok for you   if you express that you re annoyed or bothered      when you try to conform and fit in as much as you can but yet still feel and seem like a sore thumb sticking out    when you constantly have to edit yourself to make a point  only to realize that you re sacrificing your own right to speak your views because you re too worried about what others may feel or think      i liked french and the language  but i was always worried about not getting tenses and grammar right or perfect   i think if i could have overcome that fear  maybe i d be at least be fluent by now        yep  that arrogance would turn me off    this is probably one of the main reasons i ve always liked france or the idea of it   very bohemian       i think it s the idea of a more slow paced life  where you enjoy the moment rather than      yes  for some reason  people tell me personal stuff including their entire life story  telling me things they would never tell anyone else and i barely know them well     i am not sure it s a      very beautiful poems   you ve said what many have felt and hope one day to hear from the one they love someday   happy    yeah  not a fan of fighting to get my way   never works   in the end  after i ve exerted an enormous amount of energy  i still rarely get what is needed   so  i ve given up asserting or
